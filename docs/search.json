    "text": "Patient Recruitment\nIn this particular clinical trial example patient recruitment is a a key factor to the success or failure. With a rare disease, the vaccine will need to be administered to a large number of people and potentially on a longer duration.\nOptimising the clinical trial design whilst considering patient recruitment, duration in addition to statistical properties increases the likelihood of success, reduces the cost, and gets a vaccine to patients that urgently need it sooner - saving lives!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKerusCloud allows for up to 10 recruitment sites allows you to modify recruitment rates between sites and over time.\nIn addition you can add a cap to set the maximum number of patients recruited from specific site(s). This allows you to highly customise your recruitment strategies!\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment Sites\nIn this example we have 4 recruitment sites in 4 different countries in Africa. Maps are always a good introductory visualisation as they set the geographical context of a project and provide an indication of the scope of a project.\n\n\nCode\n# Load the library.\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Make a map\nleaflet() %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;% # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng = c(9.0820, 30.55, 7.54, 17.607), lat = c(8.6753, -22.93, 5.554, -8.08), popup = c(\"Site A\", \"Site B\", \"Site C\", \"Site D\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment Profile\n\nRecruitment SiteRecruitment Profile\n\n\nA waffle plot can tell us how many patients we’re recruiting from individual sites which is useful for logistical planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding time into our recruitment profile allows us to know how long a clinical trial will take and allowing planning of interim analyses or alternative study designs such as group sequential."

A correlation matrix provides a summary of these relationships and allows statisticians to sense check if their model assumptions are correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world, trials aren’t as perfect as simulations patients will drop-out over time and accounting for this allows a trial to be de-risked. An upset plot is a good visualisation to see the overlap between different variables. Here as we’re getting missingness due to drop-outs we expect an overlap in missingness over time - if someone drops out early in the trial, they’re be missing for repeated measures."
